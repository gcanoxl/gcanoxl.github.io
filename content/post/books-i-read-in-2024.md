# Books I Read in 2024
Today is 2024 Dec 31, the last day of 2024. 

Here, I present the books I read in this year and give some of my insights for each of them.

If you are looking for a book, I hope this helps.

## <Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban>

It is the third book of the Harry Potter series.

In the past 3 years, I kept reading it at a speed of one book a year.

While its plot is indeed fascinating and captivating, I won't give many comments on a fully fiction novel book and just want to say:

If you feel bored and want to read something to only pass the time, then it deserves your attention.

## 《被讨厌的勇气》

这是一本很多人推荐的书，通过青年与哲人的对话，讲述阿德勒心理学。

其实早在高中时期，我就读过一遍，但是当时由于人生阅历的匮乏，和多年来中国式教育的浸润，我完全无法理解这本书的真谛，更无法接纳书中所给出的人生建议，只认为是鸡汤，是奶头乐，是阿Q精神。但今年我重读了一遍，可以说是字字珠玑，亦是对我的生活及幸福重建起了很大的启迪作用。

简单来说，这本书的种种观点可以被浓缩为两点：一是课题分离，二是归属感与三大课题。

### 课题分离

阿德勒认为，一切烦恼皆源自人际关系，而根源是无法进行课题分离。

比如，你穿的好看是你的课题，但别人不认为你好看是别人的课题，你不能干涉别人的课题。类似的，你有没有认真工作是你的课题，但老板有没有给你加薪是老板的课题，你不能干涉老板的课题。

我高中时读的时候，就是对这个表示困惑，因为，别人的课题会切实影响我的生活啊，我怎么能不干涉呢？对此，阿德勒的答案是归属感以及三大课题，即：工作课题，交友课题，爱的课题。

坦白说，对于归属感这个词，或许是由于人生阅历还是过于匮乏，第二次阅读这本书，依然没有完全理解阿德勒口中的归属感是什么意思。对其三大课题，倒是有一部分体会，但因为自我感觉理解深度不够，在这里依然不准备说太多。

我真正想说的，其实是这本书最后几章的一个小观点，这个观点极大的缓解了我生活中的各种 —— 人生之舞。

### 人生之舞

阿德勒认为，人根本无法预测自己的人生轨迹。这个论点我这些年回过头去看自己的前24年，真是非常透彻，莫说24年，两年前的自己给自己规划的状态，和实际的自己完全不同。

一旦接受了这个观点，就会有两种感觉同时袭来，一是恐慌感，二是摆脱感。

既然人无法预测和决定自己的未来，那么当下对未来的焦虑就毫无意义。那我们能做什么呢？只能“舞好当下”比如要高考，不需要去思考自己能考多少分，不要去纠结自己距离目标还有多远，只要舞好当下，认真背当下的每一个单词，做当下的每一道数学题。

当我放弃去掌控人生的每个方面，只是做当下最想做的事情，焦虑情绪减少了非常多。

## <The Willpower Instinct>

I had bought the printed version of this book as early as 2016, that in Chinese. However, in view of its poor translation, I didn't understand and absorb its content well.

After reading its original version, I found that this book is profoundly effective in changing the way of how people think willpower instinct. 

The whole training program this book provides is devided into 10 parts, one for a week. It is designed to gradually and practically improve one's willpower during the 10 weeks. 

Here, I'm only naming a few of the most impressive and far-reaching points:

### Willpower is not about morality

In traditional Asia culture, Chinese culture in particular, people with poor willpower are simply writen off as slob, unworthy of interaction at all. However, this book pointed out that all human are born to resist temptation and do harder things.

If one can not, it is not because his the wrong person, but because of his wrong state. Through systematically training, one can improve his willpower and is geared to better better self-control.

### Willpower has more to do with physical state than mental state

One of the topmost significant aspects provided by this book is physical state, including: food, sleep and exercise.

A little bit ironically, eating health food and sleeping early themselves are things that need willpower and give you back more willpower in return in a long term. 

Doesn't such a mechanism of building willpower sound like that of exceeding compensation when buidling muscle?

## <The Pursuit of Perfect>

Back in late 2019, when I was watching Postive Psychology with a view to alleviate my depression, a open course taught by Prof. Tal Ben Shahar at Harvard, this book was recommended by him, who is also the author of the book.

It is a wonderful and functional book that helps relieve you of the shackle of perfectionism. (Much as its name looks suggesting the exact opposite)

Here, I only mention 2 gists that affected me the most.

### How to accept aging

It can be traced back to my early childhood of my fear of aging and death. I can vividly remember that afternoon, while I was sitting in the couch and watching TV. It was playing that Sun Wukong disturbed the netherworld(part of the TV Serie, Journey to the West).
